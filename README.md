# Patient-Health-Predicting-System
Using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression) on CSV data to predict patient health outcomes, we analyzed the distribution of General_Health categories. Each algorithm's performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and detailed classification metrics. SVM effectively classifies patients based on diverse parameters, while Random Forest and Gradient Boosting offer robust predictions by aggregating multiple decision trees. The models demonstrated varied precision, recall, and F1 scores across different health categories, collectively enhancing the predictive understanding of patient health outcomes.
